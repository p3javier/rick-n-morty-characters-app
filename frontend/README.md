# Rick And Morty App Frontend Package

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I've decided to use CRA in order to save time with the initial project setup.

## Libraries Used

This project uses the following set of libraries:

- **React**: As the frontend visualization framework.
- **Redux**: For global state management.
- **Jest**: As the test runner.
- **Testing Library**: Utility library to make easier write tests that resemble how the app is going to be used.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and it's useful as documentation and to reduce the ammount of tests needed.
- **Axios**: For REST API handling, it's like the native *Fetch API* but on steroids.
- **ESLint**: As the linter. For static analysis of code and to enforce consistent code style in the app.
- **Prettier**: For enhanced code formatting.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
