# Rick And Morty App Backend Package

Backend for the Rick And Morty App.

## Libraires used

This project uses the following set of libraries not mentioned in the main project's README.md:

- **cors**: CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
- **ts-node**: ts-node is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js.

It JIT transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, enabling you to directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling.

### `npm run dev`

To run the dev server with *nodemon*. Hot reloading available.

### `npm run lint` && `npm run lint:fix`

To run the lint in the project and allow ESLint to fix the error automatically when possible, respectively.

### `npm run build` & `npm run clean`

To compile TypeScript into production JavaScript inside the `dist` folder.
